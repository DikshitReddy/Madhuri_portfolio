## How it all started

 I began by studying the subjectâ€™s facial features, expressions, and unique characteristics, ensuring that I captured their essence and personality. The painting process involved layering colors, refining details, and carefully balancing light and shadow to bring out the depth and emotion in each portrait. Throughout, I focused on conveying not just the physical likeness but also the underlying emotions, making each portrait a personal and expressive work of art.
